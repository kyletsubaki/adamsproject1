Project 1: Greeting the User
Subject: Input/Output to the stream

Instructions: Your objective is to write a program that allows a user to input their name and age and be greeted by the output stream. Further instructions are written as comments in greet.cpp above both Greet() and main(). Anywhere you see "TODO" written is where you should write the implementation.

Example Runs...

Enter your name: Adam
Enter your age: 19
Hello, Adam! You are 19 years old.

Enter your name: Kristen
Enter your age: 22
Hello, Kristen! You are 22 years old.
